    "title": "The Physics of Traffic Behavior",
    "order": 1,
    "content": "Some years ago, when several theoretical physicists, principally Dirk Helbing and Boris Kerner of\\nStuttgart, Germany, began publishing papers on traffic flow in publications normally read by traffic\\nengineers, they were clearly working outside their usual sphere of investigation. They had noticed\\nthat if they simulated the movement of vehicles on a highway, using the equations that describe\\nhow the molecules of a gas move, some very strange results emerged. Of course, vehicles do not\\nbehave exactly like gas molecules: for example, drivers try to avoid collisions by slowing down when\\nthey get too near another vehicle, whereas gas molecules have no such concern. However, the\\nphysicists modified the equations to take the differences into account and the overall description of\\ntraffic as a flowing gas has proved to be a very good one; the moving-gas model of traffic\\nreproduces many phenomena seen in real-world traffic.\\nThe strangest thing that came out of these equations, however, was the implication that congestion\\ncan arise completely spontaneously; no external causes are necessary. Vehicles can be flowing\\nfreely along, at a density still well below what the road can handle, and then suddenly gel into a\\nslow-moving ooze. Under the right conditions a brief and local fluctuation in the speed or the\\ndistance between vehicles is all it takes to trigger a system-wide breakdown that persists for hours.\\nIn fact, the physicists’ analysis suggested such spontaneous breakdowns in traffic flow probably\\noccur quite frequently on highways.\\nB Though a decidedly unsettling discovery, this showed striking similarities to the phenomena\\npopularized as ‘chaos theory’. This theory has arisen from the understanding that in any complex\\ninteracting system which is made of many parts, each part affects the others. Consequently, tiny\\nvariations in one part of a complex system can grow in huge but unpredictable ways. This type of\\ndramatic change from one state to another is similar to what happens when a chemical substance\\nchanges from a vapor to a liquid. It often happens that water in a cloud remains as a gas even after\\nits temperature and density have reached the point where it could condense into water droplets.\\nHowever, if the vapor encounters a solid surface, even something as small as a speck of dust,\\ncondensation can take place and the transition from vapor to liquid finally occurs. Helbing and\\nKerner see traffic as a complex interacting system. They found that a small fluctuation in traffic\\ndensity can act as the ‘speck of dust’ causing a sudden change from freely moving traffic to\\nsynchronized traffic, when vehicles in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the same\\nspeed, making passing impossible.\\nC The physicists have challenged proposals to set a maximum capacity for vehicles on highways. They\\nargue that it may not be enough simply to limit the rate at which vehicles are allowed to enter a\\nhighway, rather, it may be necessary to time each vehicle’s entry onto a highway precisely to\\ncoincide with a temporary drop in the density of vehicles along the road. The aim of doing this\\nwould be to smooth out any possible fluctuations in the road conditions that can trigger a change in\\ntraffic behavior and result in congestion. They further suggest that preventing breakdowns in the\\nflow of traffic could ultimately require implementing the radical idea that has been suggested from\\ntime to time: directly regulating the speed and spacing of individual cars along a highway with\\ncentral computers and sensors that communicate with each car’s engine and brake controls.\\nPage 17 of 46 IELTS.org\\nD However, research into traffic control is generally centered in civil engineering departments and\\nhere the theories of the physicists have been greeted with some skepticism. Civil engineers favor a\\npractical approach to problems and believe traffic congestion is the result of poor road construction\\n(two lanes becoming one lane or dangerous curves), which constricts the flow of traffic. Engineers\\nquestioned how well the physicists’ theoretical results relate to traffic in the real world. Indeed,\\nsome engineering researchers questioned whether elaborate chaos-theory interpretations are\\nneeded at all, since at least some of the traffic phenomena the physicists’ theories predicted\\nseemed to be similar to observations that had been appearing in traffic engineering literature under\\nother names for years; observations which had straightforward cause-and-effect explanations.\\nE James Banks, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at San Diego State University in the\\nUS, suggested that a sudden slowdown in traffic may have less to do with chaos theory than with\\ndriver psychology. As traffic gets heavier and the passing lane gets more crowded, aggressive\\ndrivers move to other lanes to try to pass, which also tends to even out the speed between lanes.\\nHe also felt that another leveling force is that when a driver in a fast lane brakes a little to maintain\\na safe distance between vehicles, the shock wave travels back much more rapidly than it would in\\nthe other slower lanes, because each following driver has to react more quickly. Consequently, as a\\nroad becomes congested, the faster moving traffic is the first to slow down."
